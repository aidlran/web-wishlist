# Wishlist

The goal of this project is to make a small, serverless, single-page web app capable of displaying one or many wishlists. These wishlists are stored in JSON data files and may be encrypted symmetrically using a passphrase and can be unlocked client-side in the app (all using [OpenPGP.js](https://openpgpjs.org/)). I intend to deploy this to a URL on my GitHub pages website.
